The story behind why this was made is sort of odd, I was thinking about Matthew's game, the unmodded version, and I thought that it'd be nice if there was more in-depth battle mechanics.\n\
I of course didn't convince Matthew to do so, but I did come up with the idea of making a mod for that, so I did, and here we are now.\n\
This mod took a decent while to make, and on many occassions I found myself facing the fact that writing is not my strongsuit.\n\
I worked past this though, and ended up with a few extra jokes a things here and there to spice up the decently mundaine experiece of the game.\n\
If you're wanting to know a bit about me and Matthew nowadays, we're actually working together in addition to Jasun Burdick and Corbin Roberts on a new game.\n\
Isle of Hamsters is a exploration tower defense RTS with factory building mechanics set on an alien planet where you command giant hamsters.\n\
So yeah, I'm glad that you read this, but if you're sitting there thinking to yourself... hmmm... I wonder if the 'sequel' to this game will ever come, \
worry not, for it will... just give me a bit, game dev's hard enough with 1 game, even more so 2, but I've already started to think of new features. \
You can expect to see many new features in the sequel including but not limited to:\n\
    More complicated status effects\n\
    Multiple units working for the player\n\
    Bigger fights\n\
    More emphasis on reproducing enemies(not just the final boss LOL)\n\
    Better balance on weapons\n\
    New and interesting genres\n\
    Temporary summons that exist for single battles that aren't as janky as the heads LOL\n\
    More complicated movement, so not just the lever 'puzzle'\n\
    And much much more!!!\n\
    Oh yeah, and real time gameplay =] It's still a text adventure though, don't worry.\n\
... Anyways, I can't wait to see what you all think of this stuff! And if you're lucky, maybe I'll even put these games on Steam!!!\n\
So... uh... Ciao!");
