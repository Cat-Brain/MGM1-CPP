MGM1 is short for Matthew's Game Modded 1. This version of MGM1 is the C++ edition.

MGM1 CPP edition is the C++ remake of MGM1 Python edition (which can be found here https://github.com/Cat-Brain/MGM1Python) with various QOL updates over the original, as well as cleaner code, and some new features such as the magic lesson, that wasn't in MGM1 Python edition nor Matthew's Game.

MGM1 is a text-adventure style video game with a strong focus on combat, after all, the mod was originally made for the combat. It also includes the story we all know and love from Matthew's Game original as well as new story beats, most of which are in some way tied to combat.
